Below is a brief description of several clustering algorithms, and the table provides references to the other clustering algorithms in scikit-learn. \n\n* **Affinity Propagation** does not require the number of clusters $K$ to be known in advance! AP uses a \"message passing\" paradigm to cluster points based on their similarity. \n\n* **Spectral Clustering** uses the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the data before clustering in a lower dimensional space. This is tangentially similar to what we did to visualize k-means clusters using PCA. The number of clusters must be known a priori.\n\n* **Ward's Method** applies to hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering algorithms take a set of data and successively divide the observations into more and more clusters at each layer of the hierarchy. Ward's method is used to determine when two clusters in the hierarchy should be combined into one. It is basically an extension of hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering is *divisive*, that is, all observations are part of the same cluster at first, and at each successive iteration, the clusters are made smaller and smaller. With hierarchical clustering, a hierarchy is constructed, and there is not really the concept of \"number of clusters.\" The number of clusters simply determines how low or how high in the hierarchy we reference and can be determined empirically or by looking at the [dendogram](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html).\n\n* **Agglomerative Clustering** is similar to hierarchical clustering but but is not divisive, it is *agglomerative*. That is, every observation is placed into its own cluster and at each iteration or level or the hierarchy, observations are merged into fewer and fewer clusters until convergence. Similar to hierarchical clustering, the constructed hierarchy contains all possible numbers of clusters and it is up to the analyst to pick the number by reviewing statistics or the dendogram.\n\n* **DBSCAN** is based on point density rather than distance. It groups together points with many nearby neighbors. DBSCAN is one of the most cited algorithms in the literature. It does not require knowing the number of clusters a priori, but does require specifying the neighborhood size."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Clustering Algorithms in Scikit-learn\n<table border=\"1\">\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"15%\" />\n<col width=\"16%\" />\n<col width=\"20%\" />\n<col width=\"27%\" />\n<col width=\"22%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead valign=\"bottom\">\n<tr><th>Method name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Scalability</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Geometry (metric used)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td>K-Means</span></a></td>\n<td>number of clusters</td>\n<td>Very large<span class=\"pre\">n_samples</span>, medium <span class=\"pre\">n_clusters</span> with\nMiniBatch code</td>\n<td>General-purpose, even cluster size, flat geometry, not too many clusters</td>\n<td>Distances between points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Affinity propagation</td>\n<td>damping, sample preference</td>\n<td>Not scalable with n_samples</td>\n<td>Many clusters, uneven cluster size, non-flat geometry</td>\n<td>Graph distance (e.g. nearest-neighbor graph)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Mean-shift</td>\n<td>bandwidth</td>\n<td>Not scalable with <span class=\"pre\">n_samples</span></td>\n<td>Many clusters, uneven cluster size, non-flat geometry</td>\n<td>Distances between points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Spectral clustering</td>\n<td>number of clusters</td>\n<td>Medium <span class=\"pre\">n_samples</span>, small <span class=\"pre\">n_clusters</span></td>\n<td>Few clusters, even cluster size, non-flat geometry</td>\n<td>Graph distance (e.g. nearest-neighbor graph)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ward hierarchical clustering</td>\n<td>number of clusters</td>\n<td>Large <span class=\"pre\">n_samples</span> and <span class=\"pre\">n_clusters</span></td>\n<td>Many clusters, possibly connectivity constraints</td>\n<td>Distances between points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Agglomerative clustering</td>\n<td>number of clusters, linkage type, distance</td>\n<td>Large <span class=\"pre\">n_samples</span> and <span class=\"pre\">n_clusters</span></td>\n<td>Many clusters, possibly connectivity constraints, non Euclidean\ndistances</td>\n<td>Any pairwise distance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>DBSCAN</td>\n<td>neighborhood size</td>\n<td>Very large <span class=\"pre\">n_samples</span>, medium <span class=\"pre\">n_clusters</span></td>\n<td>Non-flat geometry, uneven cluster sizes</td>\n<td>Distances between nearest points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Gaussian mixtures</td>\n<td>many</td>\n<td>Not scalable</td>\n<td>Flat geometry, good for density estimation</td>\n<td>Mahalanobis distances to  centers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Birch</td>\n<td>branching factor, threshold, optional global clusterer.</td>\n<td>Large <span class=\"pre\">n_clusters</span> and <span class=\"pre\">n_samples</span></td>\n<td>Large dataset, outlier removal, data reduction.</td>\n<td>Euclidean distance between points</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nSource: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"span5 alert alert-info\">\n<h3>Exercise Set VI</h3>\n\n<p><b>Exercise:</b> Try clustering using the following algorithms. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Affinity propagation\n<li>Spectral clustering\n<li>Agglomerative clustering\n<li>DBSCAN\n</ol>\n<p>How do their results compare?
