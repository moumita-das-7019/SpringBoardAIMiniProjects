There are nearly an infinite number of different types of regression models and each regression model is typically defined by the distribution of the prediction errors (called \"residuals\") of the type of data. Logistic regression is used to model binary outcomes whereas Poisson regression is used to predict counts. In this exercise, we'll see some examples of linear regression as well as Train-test splits.\n\nThe packages we'll cover are: `statsmodels`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

This method assumes the relationship between each predictor $X$ is **linearly** related to the dependent variable $Y$. The most basic linear regression model contains one independent variable $X$, we'll call this the simple model. \n\n$$ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is considered as an unobservable random variable that adds noise to the linear relationship. In linear regression, $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0. In other words, what this means is that on average, if we know $Y$, a roughly equal number of predictions $\\hat{Y}$ will be above $Y$ and others will be below $Y$. That is, on average, the error is zero. The residuals, $\\epsilon$ are also assumed to be \"i.i.d.\": independently and identically distributed. Independence means that the residuals are not correlated -- the residual from one prediction has no effect on the residual from another prediction. Correlated errors are common in time series analysis and spatial analyses.\n\n* $\\beta_0$ is the intercept of the linear model and represents the average of $Y$ when all independent variables $X$ are set to 0.\n\n* $\\beta_1$ is the slope of the line associated with the regression model and represents the average effect of a one-unit increase in $X$ on $Y$.\n\n* Back to the simple model. The model in linear regression is the *conditional mean* of $Y$ given the values in $X$ is expressed a linear function.  \n\n$$ y = f(x) = E(Y | X = x)$$ \n\n![conditional mean](images/conditionalmean.png)\nhttp://www.learner.org/courses/againstallodds/about/glossary.html\n\n* The goal is to estimate the coefficients (e.g. $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$). We represent the estimates of the coefficients with a \"hat\" on top of the letter.  \n\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1 $$\n\n* Once we estimate the coefficients $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, we can use these to predict new values of $Y$ given new data $X$.\n\n$$\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1$$\n\n* Multiple linear regression is when you have more than one independent variable and the estimation involves matrices\n    * $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, $\\ldots$\n\n\n* How do you estimate the coefficients?

This means that the number of rooms, `RM`, is a statisticall significant predictor of `PRICE`. The regression coefficient for `RM` of 9.1021 means that *on average, each additional room is associated with an increase of $\\$9,100$ in house price net of the other variables*. The confidence interval gives us a range of plausible values for this average change, about ($\\$8,279, \\$9,925$), definitely not chump change. \n\nIn general, the $\\hat{\\beta_i}, i > 0$ can be interpreted as the following: \"A one unit increase in $x_i$ is associated with, on average, a $\\hat{\\beta_i}$ increase/decrease in $y$ net of all other variables.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the interpretation for the intercept, $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ is the average of $y$ given that all of the independent variables $x_i$ are 0."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"####  `statsmodels` formulas\n***\nThis formula notation will seem familiar to `R` users, but will take some getting used to for people coming from other languages or are new to statistics.\n\nThe formula gives instruction for a general structure for a regression call. For `statsmodels` (`ols` or `logit`) calls you need to have a Pandas dataframe with column names that you will add to your formula. In the below example you need a pandas data frame that includes the columns named (`Outcome`, `X1`,`X2`, ...), but you don't need to build a new dataframe for every regression. Use the same dataframe with all these things in it. The structure is very simple:\n\n`Outcome ~ X1`\n\nBut of course we want to to be able to handle more complex models, for example multiple regression is doone like this:\n\n`Outcome ~ X1 + X2 + X3`\n\nIn general, a formula for an OLS multiple linear regression is\n\n`Y ~ X1 + X2 + ... + Xp`\n\nThis is the very basic structure but it should be enough to get you through the homework. Things can get much more complex. You can force statsmodels to treat variables as categorical with the `C()` function, call numpy functions to transform data such as `np.log` for extremely-skewed data, or fit a model without an intercept by including `- 1` in the formula.

It is always best to check that these assumptions are valid after fitting a linear regression model.\n\n<div class=\"span5 alert alert-danger\">\n<ul>\n  <li>**Linearity**. The dependent variable $Y$ is a linear combination of the regression coefficients and the independent variables $X$. This can be verified with a scatterplot of each $X$ vs. $Y$ and plotting correlations among $X$. Nonlinearity can sometimes be resolved by [transforming](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/318) one or more independent variables, the dependent variable, or both. In other cases, a [generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) or a [nonlinear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression) may be warranted.</li>\n  <li>**Constant standard deviation**. The SD of the dependent variable $Y$ should be constant for different values of X. We can check this by plotting each $X$ against $Y$ and verifying that there is no \"funnel\" shape showing data points fanning out as $X$ increases or decreases. Some techniques for dealing with non-constant variance include weighted least squares (WLS), [robust standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity-consistent_standard_errors), or variance stabilizing transformations.\n    </li>\n  <li> **Normal distribution for errors**.  The $\\epsilon$ term we discussed at the beginning are assumed to be normally distributed. This can be verified with a fitted values vs. residuals plot and verifying that there is no pattern, and with a quantile plot.\n  $$ \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$$\nSometimes the distributions of responses $Y$ may not be normally distributed at any given value of $X$.  e.g. skewed positively or negatively. </li>\n<li> **Independent errors**.

Correlated predictors typically do not majorly affect prediction, but do inflate standard errors of coefficients making interpretation unreliable. Common solutions are dropping the least important variables involved in the correlations, using regularlization, or, when many predictors are highly correlated, considering a dimension reduction technique such as principal component analysis (PCA).\n  <li>**Influential Points:** Data points that have undue influence on the regression model. These points can be high leverage points or outliers.
